# EnigmaTs

This is a faithfull recreation (or at least as far as I could make it) of the German Enigma machine
used in World War 2 for encryption. 

For me personally, this is a learning project. Where I have been mainly a user of dynamically typed
languages (specifically Python), I'm trying to learn typescript to learn the advantages of strongly
typed principles.

You can see the full app [here](https://mke21.github.io/EnigmaTS/).

Will add more later.
